## Language & Localization

**IMPORTANT**: Before executing, check the user's language preference:

1. **Read language setting**: Check `.vipd/config.yml` for `language: <code>`.
   - If the file doesn't exist or `language` is not set, default to `en` (English).
   - Supported: `en` (English), `zh` (中文)

2. **Localize ALL user-facing output**: All messages, prompts, questions, completion
   reports, gate check outputs, status updates, and summaries that you present to the
   user MUST be in the configured language. Keep technical terms (IPD, TR gates,
   file paths, command names, code blocks) in English.

3. **Key translations** (use these when language is `zh`):

   | English | 中文 |
   |---------|------|
   | "Proceed anyway? (yes/no)" | "是否继续？(yes/no)" |
   | "IPD mode ACTIVE" | "IPD 模式已激活" |
   | "SDD-only mode — skip, proceed normally" | "仅 SDD 模式 — 跳过，正常进行" |
   | "Completion Report" | "完成报告" |
   | "Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks" | "强制执行后钩子" |
   | "Extension Hooks" | "扩展钩子" |

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks (扩展钩子)

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks (扩展钩子)

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## IPD Gate Check

**TR2/TR3 — Plan & Design Gate**: Verify prior TR gates passed before planning.

1. **IPD mode detection**: Run `EXECUTE_COMMAND: .specify/scripts/powershell/gate-detect-ipd-mode.ps1 -Json`
   - If `ipd_mode: true` → IPD mode ACTIVE — continue gate check
   - If `ipd_mode: false` → SDD-only mode — skip, proceed normally

2. **Gate validation (IPD mode only)**: Run `EXECUTE_COMMAND: .specify/scripts/powershell/gate-check.ps1 -Gate TR2_TR3 -Json`
   - If `status: passed` → proceed
   - If `status: failed` → display unmet criteria. Ask (in configured language): "Proceed to planning anyway? (yes/no)" If no, halt.

3. **Post-planning**: Generate Architecture Decision Log as TR3 evidence.

4. **Gate status recording**: On TR2/TR3 pass, run `EXECUTE_COMMAND: .specify/scripts/powershell/gate-record.ps1 -Gate TR2_TR3 -Status passed -Evidence "Plan created with Gate Readiness + ADL"`
## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_plan`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks (扩展钩子)

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks (扩展钩子)

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## Completion Report

Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Update the plan reference between the `<!-- SPECKIT START -->` and `<!-- SPECKIT END -->` markers in `CLAUDE.md` to point to the plan file created in step 1 (the IMPL_PLAN path)

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated agent context file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation and agent context files
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Done When

- [ ] Plan workflow executed and design artifacts generated
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with branch, plan path, and generated artifacts
